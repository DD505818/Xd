# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide provides instructions for deploying the alert system, confirmation signals, risk management, and trade execution modules.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A Google Cloud account with the necessary APIs enabled.
- A Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster.
- An OpenShift cluster.
- The `api_keys.json` file with your API keys and secrets.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Google Cloud Run

1. Ensure the necessary Google Cloud APIs are enabled:
   - Artifact Registry
   - Cloud Run
   - IAM Credentials API

2. Create and configure a Workload Identity Provider for GitHub.

3. Update the `.github/workflows/google-cloudrun-docker.yml` file with your project-specific values.

4. Push your changes to the main branch to trigger the deployment workflow.

### 2. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

1. Ensure the necessary Google Cloud APIs are enabled:
   - Artifact Registry
   - Google Kubernetes Engine
   - IAM Credentials API

2. Ensure your repository contains the necessary configuration for your GKE cluster.

3. Create and configure a Workload Identity Provider for GitHub.

4. Update the `.github/workflows/google.yml` file with your project-specific values.

5. Push your changes to the main branch to trigger the deployment workflow.

### 3. OpenShift

1. Ensure you have access to an OpenShift cluster.

2. Create the `OPENSHIFT_SERVER` and `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` repository secrets.

3. Update the `.github/workflows/openshift.yml` file with your project-specific values.

4. Push your changes to the main branch to trigger the deployment workflow.

### 4. Alert System

1. Ensure the `api_keys.json` file is properly configured with your API keys and secrets.

2. Run the `deploy.sh` script to set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

3. The alert system will be deployed as part of the `deploy.sh` script.

### 5. Confirmation Signals

1. Ensure the `api_keys.json` file is properly configured with your API keys and secrets.

2. Run the `deploy.sh` script to set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

3. The confirmation signals module will be deployed as part of the `deploy.sh` script.

### 6. Risk Management

1. Ensure the `api_keys.json` file is properly configured with your API keys and secrets.

2. Run the `deploy.sh` script to set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

3. The risk management module will be deployed as part of the `deploy.sh` script.

### 7. Trade Execution

1. Ensure the `api_keys.json` file is properly configured with your API keys and secrets.

2. Run the `deploy.sh` script to set up the virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure environment variables.

3. The trade execution module will be deployed as part of the `deploy.sh` script.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you will be able to deploy the alert system, confirmation signals, risk management, and trade execution modules to your preferred cloud platform.
